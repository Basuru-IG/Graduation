Currently, the demand for restaurant services and food diversity are growing, it sometimes makes customers confused and wasting time choosing where to go. Therefore, this project was born in order to help people solve their food choice problems. A chatbot will bring the best convenience to customers when customers can order a restaurant at any time of the day. In this project, we will bring food recommendation systems, which are software systems that make recommendations from a large range of different options and thus provide a promising solution for information overload and unhealthy food decisions. We would use some natural language understanding platform to make the chatbot clever and more useful with Vietnamese’s users. For example, if someone asking “phở ngon gần đây”, it’s should present some high-quality restaurant near by the customer.
